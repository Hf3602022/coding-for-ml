# Lecture notes

`pandas` is a data science package orignally developed by Wes McKinney. It builds on top of `numpy` to provide a higher level API for wrangling, analysing and visualising data. It is also closely coupled to matplotlib with a number of shorthand methods to create plots of data.

Our lectures on `pandas` will cover beginner and intermediate techniques in data wrangling, manipulation and visualisation.
