    "As you have learned, Python is an **Object Orientated Progamming (OOP) language**.  We can follow the standard paradigm of OOP in python by creating **classes** and then instantiating an instance of the class called an **object**.  A class offers a higher level of abstraction for your code than functions alone.  One of the key benefits for data science is that you can design your algorithms to be resuable and composed from multiple classes. \n",

    "## Coding Problem: 'Oh data scientists - can't you all just get along!'\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn the basics of OOP you will create an **Agent Based Simulation** (ABS).  ABS is a popular methodology in data science for modelling emergent behaviour when a group of simple **agents** interact with each other within an **environment**.  Agents can be thought of an object with state and behaviour.  That lends itself nicely to the concept of a class from OOP. The concept of emergence is important in ABS as we are not coding the outcome of the modelling.  We are instead coding some behavioural interaction rules between the agents and exploring what happens when we run the model and set the agents loose.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A full treatment ABS is out of scope for this course, but it is used a lot in health data science. You may have seen a number of ABS models used to model the epidemiology of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a description of our problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data scientists live in a 2 dimensional gridword. That is a (n X m) grid of cells.  Each cell can only be inhabited by a single data scientist.\n",
    "* In grid world data scientists either favour Python or R. \n",
    "* A Data Scientist has a similarity threshold where they desire a % of their neighbours to code in their favourite language too!  \n",
    "* If the agents neighbours are not similar enough the data scientist becomes unhappy and moves to a random empty location in the world!\n",
    "* The simulation will run for a maximum number of iterations.  If all agents are happy in any iteration then the simulation terminates early.\n",
    "* Agents make decisions about moving based on the state of the environment in the current iteration.  That is they have no knowledge if other data scientists are happy or unhappy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This problem is actually a classic ABS modelling study by Schelling that studied the dynamics of segregation in populations."
