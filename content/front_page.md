# Preface

Data science and machine learning are exciting rapidly evolving disciplines that offer huge potential for the future of health care, medicine and wider areas of science.  To keep up with the pace of change a modern data scientist requires fundamental skills in coding.  This content of this book will: 

* Boost your Python coding skills to a level where they are ready to undertake research and applied projects in data science and machine learning in health, medicine and general industry.
* Introduce you to the complexity of working with real world data in a health and medicine context.
* Introduce key machine learning concepts in supervised learning including an introduction to deep learning.
* Teach you coding skills that are transferable outside of health and medicine.
