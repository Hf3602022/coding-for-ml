    "# Algorithm and code design matters\n",
    "\n",
    "As your experience in data science grows I have no doubt that one lesson your will repeatedly learn is the importance of a good algorithm.  A good algorithm can turn a seven day model run time into 4 hours (and a 14 day run time due to finding a mistake in the first run into an 8 hour run). A related lesson is that how you design your code to implement an algorithm also matters.  Indeed the decisions you make in implementation can also have an order of magnitude impact on run time.  In this section we will explore a simple problem - computing (small) prime numbers and how the choice of algorithm and its implementation can affect run time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the primes up to 10. First write out a list of number 2 to 10. Here we'll represent this as a python list called `candidates`.  As we work out which numbers are not primes we will cross (sieve) them out. For simplicity of illustration we will store those in a list called `crossed_out` \n",

Could we make further improvements in its basic design? Yes we can.  For instance.  We know that all even numbers above two cannot be primes.  We therefore don't even need to consider these in our algorithm.  This not only reduces computation, but we can also half the size of our data structure (you might try this an exercise).\n",

    "We've seen that a good algorithm makes a huge difference to what is feasible to compute.  A trial and error approach to computing primes prevented us from even finding relatively small prime numbers in a reasonable time frame.  The **Sieve of Eratosthenes** made the unfeasible suddenly feasible.  We've also seen that the design of code can also effect execution time by an order of magnitude.  But not all optimisations will have a huge impact on performance and some optimisation may scale with our problem size.  "
