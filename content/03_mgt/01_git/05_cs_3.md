# Case study: Branching and merging

```{admonition} You should always use branches even when working alone.
Strictly speaking it is best practice to use a branch to create new features and conduct testing. We have ignored branching so far to keep our introductory material as simple as possible. Ideally you always have a clean (and as best you can bug free) main (master) branch that you or your users/colleagues use for production.  Obviously if you are working on your own then simplicity is key. A minimum safe option is to create a `dev` branch where you work towards a new version of your code (perhaps a group of new features) and then merge when everything is complete and tested. 
``` 

## Scenario
Now that you fix the master branch of the repo the code will run correctly every night.
