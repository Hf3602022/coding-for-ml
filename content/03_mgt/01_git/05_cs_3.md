# Case study: Branching and merging

> This case study assumes you have worked through case studies 1 and 2.

A key feature of version control is the ability to create a **branch** seperate from the main code that are used for development.  Once the code within a branch is complete it is **merged** into the repo's master branch.

```{admonition} You should always use branches even when working alone.
Strictly speaking it is best practice to use a branch to create new features and conduct testing. We have ignored branching so far to keep our introductory material as simple as possible. Ideally you always have a clean (and as best you can bug free) main (master) branch that you or your users/colleagues use for production.  Obviously if you are working on your own then simplicity is key. A minimum safe option is to create a `dev` branch where you work towards a new version of your code (perhaps a group of new features) and then merge when everything is complete and tested. 
``` 

## Scenario
Now that you reverted the master branch to the last working version the code will run correctly every night.  In parrallel you will create a new branch and fix the bug in the modified code.  Once you are satified it works you will merge the code into the master branch to use in production.

To do this you will need to 

* Create and checkout a new branch called `dev`
* Restore the version of `main.py` that contains the bug
* Fix and test the bug
* Merge the `dev` branch into `main`

## Step 1: Create and checking out a new branch

We create a new branch using the `git branch <branch_name>` command.  To fix the bug we will work on a branch called `dev`

```bash
$ git branch dev
$ git branch
```

The second command will list all of the branches available in the repo.

```bash
  dev
* master
```

The output reports that there are two available `dev` and `master`.  The `*` indicates the active branch.  To **switch** the dev branch we can either

```bash
$ git switch dev
$ git checkout dev
```

Both `git checkout` and `git switch` will move the branch you are working on to `dev`.

At this point the code in `dev` is an identical copy of `master` with the same commit history.  

## Step 2: restore the buggy code.

One option now is to write the new code from scratch again - this time making sure that is properly tested and working before merging into main.  This isn't really making the most of git, however.  Instead we will **restore** the buggy version of `main.py` and fix it in the `dev` branch.  First let's have a look at the git commit log.

```bash
73fcaa5 (HEAD -> dev, master) Revert "MAIN:+do_something_else() extends analysis"
e1c4fd3 MAIN:+do_something_else() extends analysis
6475df6 DOCS: run instructions
```
The commit that contains the target version of `main.py` is `e1c4fd3`. Next we restore the file, add it to the staging area and commit it to `dev`.

```bash
$ git restore --source e1c4fd3 main.py
$ git add main.py
$ git commit -m "FIX: restore main.py to e1c4fd3"
```
The file `main.py`, including the bug, has now been restored, but it only in the `dev` branch.  

```python
'''
main module

'''

def do_something():
    print('Friendly code')

def do_something_else():
    print('This is a major bug!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    do_something()
    do_something_else()
```

## Step 3: Fix the bug

The fixed `main.py` now looks like

```python
'''
main module

Fix issued by TM.
'''

def do_something():
    print('Friendly code')

def do_something_else():
    print('Expected value')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    do_something()
    do_something_else()
```

It's the end of the working day. You haven't had time to test your fix, so you won't risk merging it with master.  But you stage and commit it to `dev` before you leave.

```bash
$ git add main.py
$ git commit -m "FIX: do_something_else() patched."
```

You can also quickly switch back to master (`git switch master`) we can confirm the code in `main.py` that will run overnight is the original version.

## Step 4: Test and merge the code.

The next day you have plenty of time to test the new code works.  Switching to the `dev` branch we can run

```bash
$ python3 main.py

Friendly code
Expected value
```
This confirms everything has worked as expected so we can **merge** the new version of the code into master.

To complete the merge we need to switch to the `master` branch and use the `merge` command.

```bash
$ git switch master
$ git merge dev

Updating 73fcaa5..6fcbf0d
Fast-forward
 main.py | 10 ++++++++--
 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

Just to prove to ourselves that the merge has worked we can check the log.

```bash
$ git log -4 --oneline

6fcbf0d (HEAD -> master, dev) FIX: do_something_else() patched.
2e9cfcd FIX: restore main.py to e1c4fd3
73fcaa5 Revert "MAIN:+do_something_else() extends analysis"
e1c4fd3 MAIN:+do_something_else() extends analysis
```
and that's it you now have updated your code base.
