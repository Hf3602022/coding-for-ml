# Managing Data Science Projects

So you now know how to code in Python and a few of its data science and machine learning extensions. Congratualations! The truth is, however, that this is only the beginning of your journey in health data science. When you start your first job, perhaps in genomics or building machine learning models for a big company, you need to know how to manage and deploy code.  

In the final part of the book we will look at:

1. Local and remote version control
2. Setting up and orgaising local python packages
3. Deploying python packages on the Python Package Index (PyPi)
